## Blind Deconvolution Using Convex Programming

_Abstract:_ We study the question of recovering two signals w and x from their convolution y = w ∗ x. Generally, the 
solution to this blind deconvolution problem is non-unique and non-convex. But with assumptions on sparsity, subspace 
structure and transformed variable, we can convert the non-convex nuclear norm into a convex problem by ”dual-dual” 
relaxation. In this project, we also implement the convex algorithm proposed in Blind Deconvolution Using Convex 
Programming, and compare its performance with non-blind and non-convex algorithms. Moreover, the evaluation shows that 
the convex algorithm is robust against sparsity violation, but sensitive to low-rank condition. At last, we try to 
extend the algorithm to 2D deconvolution by recovering a blurred image. But the result on 2D deconvolution still need 
improvement.

## ML-based Matrix Optimization in Massive MIMO

_Abstract:_ In the downlink of massive MIMO, the transmitter uses precoding technology to reduce interference and 
improve spectrum efficiency. A complex-valued gradient neural network (CVGNN) is proposed to solve the 
Moore-Penrose inverse of the complex matrix in massive MIMO precoding algorithms. Theoretical linear convergence and 
numerical results are provided to corroborate the application of CVGNN in wireless communication senarios.
