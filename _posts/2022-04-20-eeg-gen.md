_Abstract:_ Processing and analysis of brain signals generally requires a large amount of data. But the acquisition of EEG signals is difficult while the sample size of the data set is small, and sometimes categories are unbalanced in the data set. Based on the challenge, we proposed the WGAN-GP method, a variant of GAN, to generate useful EEG signals. The experiments on single-channel and multi-channel model both show that the performance of WGAN-GP is stable, and the generated signals have close shape with the real signals, and have better spectrum performance than traditional methods. Our results and analysis show that WGAN-GP can generate accurate and diverse EEG signals, and thus, help extend the data set which is difficult to collect physically. Weâ€™ve made the code associated with this work available at https://github.com/warrenzha/GAN-EEG-generation.
