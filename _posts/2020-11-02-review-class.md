_Abstract:_ Customer reviews on e-commerce platforms contain valuable information, while sifting through them manually tends to dismay people because of the huge amount of data. This study implemented a machine learning-based algorithm to classify customer reviews. Our classifier extracts Chinese word segmentation and text frequency for feature extraction and scoring, and implements the classification with methods of Naive Bayesian and Support Vector Machines. Experimental results on the Taobao product review sentiment datasets show that our model based on two machine learning algorithms, though results in different performances, can provide suggestions on the selection of the identification classifier using a trade-off strategy and helps obtain fast and accurate classification on reviews of different categories.
