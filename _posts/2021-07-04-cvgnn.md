_Abstract:_ In the downlink of massive MIMO, the transmitter uses precoding technology to reduce interference and improve spectrum efficiency. In this paper, a complex-valued gradient neural network (CVGNN) is proposed to solve the Moore-Penrose inversion of the complex matrix used in massive MIMO precoding algorithms.
