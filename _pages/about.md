Hi, I am Wenyuan, a first year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at [Texas A&M University](https://ece.tamu.edu), advised by Professor [Chao Tian](https://tiangroup.engr.tamu.edu). Currently I am working on information science and learning systems where new algorithms have been proposed dealing with diverse settings.

Before joining TAMU, I received my M.S. degree in Communication Theory & Systems at [UC San Diego](https://ece.ucsd.edu), where I worked on AI-driven mmWave Networking with Professor [Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu/index.html). Besides, I received my B.E. degree in Information Engineering at Southeast University in 2021.

My research interests lie in Information Theory, Machine Learning, and Communication. Particularly, I am working on deep Gaussian process and diffusion models.
